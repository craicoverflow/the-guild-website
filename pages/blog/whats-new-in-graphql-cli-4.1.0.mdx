[GraphQL CLI](http://graphql-cli.com) is your one-stop shop for developing full-stack GraphQL applications in Node.js. Since the release of 4.0.0, we have added a number of enhancements which will further elevate your GraphQL development experience.
GraphQL CLI aggregates multiple community projects giving developers the best getting started experience. Tools included in the CLI are mature and developed over the years based on Guild's experience in pushing production ready GraphQL solutions and also through collaboration with Red Hat community projects.

## GraphQL Code Generator

[Add what is new in GraphQL Codegen]

To use GraphQL Code Generator from the CLI, run `graphql codegen` from your application root:

```shell
$ graphql codegen
```

Check out the [codegen command docs](https://graphql-cli.com/codegen) on our new website for configuration and installation instructions.

## GraphQL Config

[Add what is new in GraphQL Config]

All templates come pre-configured to work with the latest version of GraphQL Config.

## Website

Reading docs just got easier. We’ve built a new website to host the GraphQL CLI documentation! Check it out at [graphql-cli.com](https://graphql-cli.com).
Init command templates
There are several improvements to all of our templates to make them cleaner and more production-ready. Additionally, we had added two new starter templates: a plain MongoDB template and a MongoDB template with out-of-the-box data synchronization support.

To start using these templates, use the init command:

```shell
$ graphql init
```

Check out the [serve command docs](https://graphql-cli.com/serve) for installation and usage guides!

## Serve command

The serve command is now powered by [graphql-serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-serve), letting you start up an in-memory GraphQL server and playground in seconds - perfect for mocking and testing!

```shell
$ graphql serve --port 4000 ./model/datamodel.graphql

Starting server...

Listening at: http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

## Graphback

All the templates are configured with Graphback, for both runtime and generation capabilities purposes. Graphback 1.0 has recently been released, check out their blog post [Announcing the Release of Graphback 1.0](https://graphback.dev/blog/2020/10/01/announcing-graphback-1.0) that goes into deeper details of Graphback’s features and capabilities.

To generate your schema and documents with Graphback, run `graphql generate` from your application root. See the [generate command docs](https://graphql-cli.com/generate) for a thorough explanation of this command and usage guides.
