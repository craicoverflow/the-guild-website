[GraphQL CLI](http://graphql-cli.com) is your one-stop shop for developing full-stack GraphQL applications in Node.js. Since the release of 4.0.0, we have added a number of enhancements which will further elevate your GraphQL development experience.

## GraphQL Code Generator

[Add what is new in GraphQL Codegen]

To use GraphQL Code Generator from the CLI, run `graphql codegen` from your application root:

```shell
$ graphql codegen
```

Check out the [codegen command docs](https://graphql-cli.com/codegen) on our new website for configuration and installation instructions.

## GraphQL Config

[Add what is new in GraphQL Config]

All templates come pre-configured to work with the latest version of GraphQL Config.

## Website

Reading docs just got easier. We’ve built a new website to host the GraphQL CLI documentation! Check it out at [graphql-cli.com](https://graphql-cli.com).
Init command templates
There are several improvements to all of our templates to make them cleaner and more production-ready. Additionally, we had added two new starter templates: a plain MongoDB template and a MongoDB template with out-of-the-box data synchronization support.

To start using these templates, use the init command:

```shell
$ graphql init
```

Check out the [serve command docs](https://graphql-cli.com/serve) for installation and usage guides!

## Serve command

The serve command is now powered by [graphql-serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-serve), letting you start up an in-memory GraphQL server and playground in seconds - perfect for mocking and testing!

```shell
$ graphql serve --port 4000 ./model/datamodel.graphql

Starting server...

Listening at: http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

## Graphback

All the templates are configured with Graphback, for both runtime and generation capabilities purposes. Graphback 1.0 has recently been released, check out their blog post [Announcing the Release of Graphback 1.0](https://graphback.dev/blog/2020/10/01/announcing-graphback-1.0) that goes into deeper details of Graphback’s features and capabilities.

To generate your schema and documents with Graphback, run `graphql generate` from your application root. See the [generate command docs](https://graphql-cli.com/generate) for a thorough explanation of this command and usage guides.
